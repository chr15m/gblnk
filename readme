Hey there!

My friend had a spare gameboy camera and a link cable from the MadCatz company. I couldn't beleive
that nobody had written transfer software for linux. So i wrote one. Here it is. Now I can take
crusty, 4 color greyscale, hax0r pictures and download them onto my computer. I still haven't got
the decompression routines completely down pat (you can see some random noise artifacts and
distortions where pixels are obviously not meant to be where they are found). Please tell me if you
know the CORRECT method of encoding found in the gb printer (which the madcatz cable emulates).

Lemme know what you think.

PS to use:

./gblnk test.bmp

The program will load.

Press 'print' on the gameboy

The program will show a '|' style spinning thing

When it's done the picture will appear.

'A' makes it small
'D' makes it big
'S' saves it as filename specified on the command line

'Esc' exits at any time.

the files madcatz.c & madcatz.txt were written by someone else. i included them as credit.
